# Workflow: PRD to Blueprint

1. **Architecture**: Call the `SW_ARCHITECTURE_AGENT.md` and provide the PRD.
2. **Design**: Call the `UI_DESIGN_AGENT.md` to establish the visual identity.
3. **Feature Spec**: Call the `UI_FEATURE_DESIGN_AGENT.md` with the ADD and UI Design to create functional blueprints.
