# Workflow: The Observability Loop

1. **Architecture**: Call `OBSERVABILITY_AGENT.md` and provide your ADD to design the monitoring strategy.
2. **Memory**: Call `MEMORY_PROMPT.md` to persist core metrics and thresholds.
3. **Instrumentation**: Direct the agent to generate code for structured logging and distributed tracing for your tech stack.
4. **Implementation**: Follow the **Implementation Loop** to code and verify the health endpoints and log injection.
5. **Memory**: Call `MEMORY_PROMPT.md` to finalized the pulse of your system.
6. **Dashboarding**: Once deployed, return to `OBSERVABILITY_AGENT.md` to design the "Founder's Pulse" dashboard.
